# Engrammer - [Arno's Engram] layout for programmers

This is a programmer-friendly variant of [Arno's Engram] 2.0 keyboard
layout that helps maintain cross-proficiency with standard keyboards:

* Shifted pairs are standard (e.g. quotes don't shift to parentheses).
* Semicolon is placed relative to comma and period just like standard.
* Equals and square brackets are placed near their standard locations.

In addition, application shortcuts that assume standard shifted pairs,
such as Control-Equals for the "zoom in" operation, now work properly.

To illustrate the differences between this layout, Engram, and QWERTY:

>*Legend:* Gold is [Arno's Engram]; Blue is Engram-like; Pink is new.

For example, here are my split ortholinear keyboards using this layout:

## Windows setup

You can [download a pre-built installation package](
  https://github.com/sunaku/engrammer/releases/download/windows/engrammer.zip
) or build one yourself, like this:

1. Install the official _Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator_ app: [MSKLC version 1.4](
  https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102134
).

2. Launch the MSKLC app and open up the `windows\engrammer.klc` source file.

3. From the "Project" menu, select the "Build DLL and Setup Package" action.

4. Open the resulting build directory and run the `setup.exe` installer file.

## MacOS setup

1. Copy `macos/Engrammer.bundle` to `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/` directory

2. Log out and Log in again to your MacOS user

3. Open Keyboard Settings and add Engrammer from the list of English layouts

## Type Fu setup

![type-fu.com](https://github.com/sunaku/engrammer/assets/9863/f90439c8-3d96-4902-b471-45511fba8c33)

1. Launch the [Type Fu](https://type-fu.com/) app, then open the "More" menu.

2. Go to Preferences > Keyboard > Functional > "More" menu > Import from file.

3. Pick the `type-fu.com/engrammer.tfl` file from your copy of this repository.

# Issues
Type-Fu likes to translate keycodes into the target layout, so it may not work as expected (Shows wrong keys are pressed). If so, try switching to QWERTY mode (Magic+6) to avoid double translation.
